# Customer Behavior Analysis on Transaction Data

## üéØ Project Objective

The goal of this project is to perform a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand and analyze customer behavior based on transaction data. The insights gained will help inform business strategies and support decision-making.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Description

The dataset used in this project is available [here](data\Store_Transaction_Data.csv). It contains the following features:

- **MONTH**: The month in which the transaction occurred.
- **STORECODE**: The unique code representing the store where the transaction took place.
- **QTY**: The quantity of items purchased in the transaction.
- **VALUE**: The monetary value of the transaction.
- **GRP**: The general category of the product purchased.
- **SGRP**: The sub-category of the product.
- **SSGRP**: The sub-sub-category of the product.
- **CMP**: The campaign or promotion associated with the transaction.
- **MBRD**: The membership ID of the customer making the transaction.
- **BRD**: The brand of the product purchased.
